# Pentest-Utils
This repository holds some small scripts I made to make life easier when pentesting

### Get Ip (getip.py)
`getip` is a util that copies your `tun0` IP address to your clipboard, requires xclip.

### Start SMB (startsmb.sh)
Important Note: if you want to use this you'll need to change the script to point to the directory where you keep your toolkit, for me it's /opt/Toolkit/Windows.  
This script opens an SMB server with `kali:kali` as username and password and smb2 support.  
It echos the files in the directory for your windows toolkit and gives you the command to use the share.
