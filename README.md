# Pentest-Utils
This repository holds some small scripts I made to make life easier when pentesting

### Get Ip (getip.py)
`getip` is a util that copies your `tun0` IP address to your clipboard, requires xclip.

### Start SMB (startsmb.sh)
Important Note: if you want to use this you'll need to change the script to point to the directory where you keep your toolkit, for me it's /opt/Toolkit/Windows.  
This script opens an SMB server with `kali:kali` as username and password and smb2 support.  
It echos the files in the directory for your windows toolkit and gives you the command to use the share.

### Get Ip Text (getiptext.py)
Utility script used by startsmb

### Simple MSF
Outputs some useful MSFVenom (OSCP-Compliant, non meterpreter, stageless payloads that can be caught with netcat) payloads.   
An important note is that I personally like my shells on port 443 but you are free to change this to any port you may desire.

### Usage
Drop these files in /usr/local/bin (or any PATH folder for that matter), rename the files to remove the extension and change the directory of the SMB script to whatever directory you want to serve consistently.
